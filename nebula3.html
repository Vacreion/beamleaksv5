Working with the BeamLeaks staff team was a really happy, yet stressful time for me, I was just learning how to build websites and the thrill of creation was fresh to me. Obviously I had coded before then, but small things purely for me, and then all of a sudden I'm at the head of a website with thousands of visits weekly. I loved that feeling and I worked hard to make sure I kept feeling it, but I wasn't being mindful. I would stay up super late every night working, sometimes not sleeping at all! Which obviously is not a super crazy thing for a teenager to do but it was EVERY night... work work work... all for a feeling! There was no pay, no real reason aside from the Joy Of Creation. Which is why I ultimately had to take a break, or maybe I left forever who knows! Maybe I'm back by the time you are reading this. Anyway, I've had my speech, you are welcome to go about your day now :3`;
